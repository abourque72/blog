This is a blog where I talk about what I'm learning or doing. I made this blog for two reasons:

1. To talk about math more, for my own benefit.

2. To talk about math more, for the benefit of others.

To elaborate on the first reason, I am a firm believer in the "Feynman technique", which essentially says that teaching or discussing something enforces your own understanding of it.

To elaborate on the second reason, I want to create accessible exposition on various topics that both inexperienced and experienced readers can appreciate.

In particular, my posts will tend to be partitioned into two blocks.

The first block is for inexperienced readers, by which I generally mean an undergraduate math student who is familiar with algebraic structures -- such as groups, rings, and modules -- and topological spaces. I will use intuitive and informal language and skip out on details.

The second block is for more experience readers, although what this means will generally vary from post to post. I won't make an effort to say what prerequisites are needed for these blocks; either you can parse the details or not. If you encounter a term that I don't explain and that you don't know, then you can search elsewhere to learn about it.
