I mistakenly said that the bounded variants of $Ch(\mc A)$ and $K(\mc A)$ are defined by conditions on the cohomology of objects. However, it should instead be conditions on the complexes themselves. In particular:

- $Ch^+(\mc A)$ and $K^+(\mc A)$ consist of complexes $A^\bullet$ for which there is an integer $N$ such that $A^i=0$ for $i\< N$.

- $Ch^-(\mc A)$ and $K^-(\mc A)$ consist of complexes $A^\bullet$ for which there is an integer $N$ such that $A^i=0$ for $i \> N$.

- $Ch^b(\mc A)$ and $K^b(\mc A)$ consists of complexes $A^\bullet$ for which there is a positive integer $N$ such that $A^i=0$ for $|i| \> N$.
